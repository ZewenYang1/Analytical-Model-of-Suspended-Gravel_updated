This MATLAB model accompanies the paper "Saturated, smashed and suppressed: the fate of suspended gravel in large palaeofloods." by Yang Zewen, Carling Paul, Liu Weiming, Wang Hao, Yang Anna, Zhou Gordon G. D. 

The model was written in MATLAB version R2017a. 

The model was used to analyse suspended gravel deposition and thick horizontal deposits formation in palaeofloods.

The model consists of the following scripts:

Model 1_HydraulicVariable.m

Model 2_SbDivideCbConcentrationProfile.m

Model 3_StProfileDistributionAndRootMeanSquareVelocity.m

Model 4_StAndTimeWITHyDivideh.m

Model 5_TKEwithBeta.m

Model 6_RWithDifferentDepthWithTime.m

Model 7_GDivideR2WithTime.m

Model 8_C_starWithGR2.m
